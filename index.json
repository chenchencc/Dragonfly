	"content": "This topic explains how to use the APIs provided by Supernode. This section describes APIs that is provided by the supernode, aka cluster manager.\nRegistration POST /peer/registry  Parameters\nParameters are encodeds as application/x-www-form-urlencoded.\n cid: string, the client id. ip: ipv4 string, the client ip address. hostName: string, the host name of client node. superNodeIp: ipv4 string, the ip address of super node. port: integer, the port which client opens. callSystem: string, the caller identifier. version: string, client version. dfdaemon: boolean, tells whether it is a call from dfdaemon. path: string, the path which client can serve. rawUrl: string, the resource url provided by command line parameter. taskUrl: string, the resource url. md5: string, the md5 checksum for the resource, optional. identifier: string, identifer for the resource. headers: map, extra http headers sent to the raw url.  Under the scene, the cluster manager creates a new instance of Task, which is built from the information provided by parameters. Specifically, it generates a taskId based on rawUrl, md5 and identifier.\nThen the task would be saved in the memory state. At the same time, it will fetch extra information like the content-length which would generally be set. Also, the pieceSize is computed with the strategy below:\n if the total size is less than 200MB, the piece size would be 4MB by default. otherwise, the minimum of (${totalSize} / 100MB) + 2MB and 15MB.  The next step is, the peer information along with the task will be recorded:\n The peerwill be saved. The taskwill be saved.  The last step is about triggering a progress.\nResponse\nAn example response:\n{ \u0026quot;code\u0026quot;: 200, \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;fileLength\u0026quot;: 687481, \u0026quot;pieceSize\u0026quot;: 4194304, \u0026quot;taskId\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ba270626349198840d0255de8358b6c93fe6d57d922d036fbf40bcf3499f44a8\u0026quot; } }  Other cases could happen:\n the task id might duplicate with an existing one. 606 the url might be invalid. 607 the access requires authentication. 608 or 609  Get Task GET /peer/task  Parameters\nParameters are encoded as query string.\n superNode: ipv4 string, the ip address of super node. dstCid: string, destination client id. range: string, byte range. status: integer. result: integer. taskId: string, the task id. srcCid: string, the source client id.  The super node will analyze the status and result firstly:\n Running if status == 701. Success if status == 702 and result == 501. Fail if status == 702 and result == 500. Wait if status == 700.  In waiting status, the super node would:\n Save the status to be running.  In running status, the super node would will extract the piece status:\n Success if result == 501. Fail if result == 500. SemiSuc if result == 503.  (side note): result == 502 means invalid code.\nAnd update the progress for this specific task. Then it checks the status itself and also the peer status, after that, the super node will tell the client another task which has enough detail for the next piece, or fails if no one is available.\nResponse\nAn example resonse:\n{ \u0026quot;code\u0026quot;: 602, \u0026quot;msg\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;client sucCount:0,cdn status:Running,cdn sucCount: 0\u0026quot; }  This means the client has to wait, since no peer can serve this piece now. And if there is a peer which can serve this request, there will be a reponse like this:\n{ \u0026quot;code\u0026quot;: 601, \u0026quot;data\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;cid\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;cdnnode:10.148.177.242~ba270626349198840d0255de8358b6c93fe6d57d922d036fbf40bcf3499f44a8\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;downLink\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;20480\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;path\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;/qtdown/ba2/ba270626349198840d0255de8358b6c93fe6d57d922d036fbf40bcf3499f44a8\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;peerIp\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;10.148.177.242\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;peerPort\u0026quot;: 8001, \u0026quot;pieceMd5\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;d78ef0af9e95e880fa583b41cf5ad791:687486\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pieceNum\u0026quot;: 0, \u0026quot;pieceSize\u0026quot;: 4194304, \u0026quot;range\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;0-4194303\u0026quot; } ] }  Peer Progress GET /peer/piece/suc  Parameters\nParameters are encoded as query string.\n dstCid: string, the destination client id. pieceRange: byte range. taskId: string, the task id. cid: string, the client id.

	"title": "What Is Dragonfly",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Dragonfly is an intelligent P2P based image and file distribution system. It aims to resolve issues related to low-efficiency, low-success rate and waste of network bandwidth in file transferring process. Especially in large-scale file distribution scenarios such as application distribution, cache distribution, log distribution, image distribution, etc.\nAt Alibaba, Dragonfly is invoked 2 billion times and the data distributed is 3.4PB every month. Dragonfly has become one of the most important pieces of infrastructure at Alibaba. The reliability is up to 99.9999%.\nWhile container technologies makes devops life easier most of the time, it sure brings a some challenges: the efficiency of image distribution, especially when you have to replicate image distribution on several hosts. Dragonfly works extremely well with both Docker and PouchContainer for this scenario. It also is compatible with any other container formats.\nIt delivers up to 57 times the throughput of native docker and saves up to 99.5% the out bandwidth of registry.\nDragonfly makes it simple and cost-effective to set up, operate, and scale any kind of files/images/data distribution.\nWhy Dragonfly? The project is an open source version of the dragonfly and more internal features will be gradually opened.\n P2P based file distribution: Using P2P technology for file transmission, which can make full use of the bandwidth resources of each peer to improve download efficiency, saves a lot of cross-IDC bandwidth, especially costly cross-board bandwidth Non-invasive support all kinds of container technologies: Dragonfly can seamlessly support various containers for distributing images. Host level speed limit: Many downloading tools(wget/curl) only have rate limit for the current download task,but dragonfly also provides rate limit for the entire host. Passive CDN: The CDN mechanism can avoid repetitive remote downloads. Strong consistency： Dragonfly can guarantee that all downloaded files must be consistent even if users do not provide any check code(MD5). Disk protection and high efficient IO: Precheck Disk space, delay synchronization, write file-block in the best order, split net-read / disk-write, and so on. High performance: Cluster Manager is completely closed-loop, which means, it does not rely on any DB or distributed cache, processing requests with extremely high performance. Exception auto isolation: Dragonfly will automatically isolate exception nodes(peer or Cluster Manager) to improve download stability. No pressure on file source: Generally, as long as a few Cluster Managers download file from the source. Support standard http header: Support http header, Submit authentication information through http header. Effective concurrency control of Registry Auth: Reduce the pressure of the Registry Auth Service. Simple and easy to use: Very few configurations are needed.  How does it stack up against traditional solution?    Test Environment      Dragonfly server 2 * (24core 64GB 2000Mb/s)   File Source server 2 * (24core 64GB 2000Mb/s)   Client 4core 8GB 200Mb/s   Target file size 200MB   Executed Date 2016-04-20    For Dragonfly, no matter how many clients issue the file downloading, the average downloading time is always around 12 seconds. And for wget, the downloading time keeps increasing when you have more clients, and as the amount of wget clients reaches 1200, the file source will crash, then it can not serve any client.\nHow does it work? Distributing General Files The cluster manager is also called supernode, which is responsible for CDN and scheduling every peer to transfer blocks between them. dfget is the client of P2P, also called \u0026lsquo;peer\u0026rsquo;,which is mainly used to download and share blocks.\nDistributing Container Images Registry is similar to the file server above. dfget proxy is also called dfdaemon, which intercepts http-requests from docker pull or docker push,and then determines which requests need use dfget to handle.\nHow file blocks are downloaded Every File is divided into multiple blocks, which are transmitted between peers,one peer is one P2P client. Cluster manager will judge whether the corresponding file exists in the local disk, if not, it will be downloaded into cluster manager from file server.\n"

It\u0026rsquo;s similar to using wget.\nAt the same time, it also plays the role of peer, which can transfer data between each other in p2p network.\nWhat is dfdaemon Dfdaemon is only used for pulling images. It establishes a proxy between dockerd/pouchd and registry.\nDfdaemon filters out layer fetching requests from all requests send by dockerd/pouchd when pulling images, then it uses dfget to downloading these layers.\n"

	"content": " It is warmly welcomed if you have interest to hack on Dragonfly. First, we encourage this kind of willing very much. And here is a list of contributing guide for you.\nTopics  Reporting security issues Reporting general issues Code and doc contribution Engage to help anything  Reporting security issues Security issues are always treated seriously. As our usual principle, we discourage anyone to spread security issues. If you find a security issue of Dragonfly, please do not discuss it in public and even do not open a public issue. Instead we encourage you to send us a private email to dragonfly-dev@service.alibaba.com to report this.\nReporting general issues To be honest, we regard every user of Dragonfly as a very kind contributor. After experiencing Dragonfly, you may have some feedback for the project. Then feel free to open an issue via NEW ISSUE.\nSince we collaborate project Dragonfly in a distributed way, we appreciate WELL-WRITTEN, DETAILED, EXPLICIT issue reports. To make the communication more efficient, we wish everyone could search if your issue is an existing one in the searching list. If you find it existing, please add your details in comments under the existing issue instead of opening a brand new one.\nTo make the issue details as standard as possible, we setup an ISSUE TEMPLATE for issue reporters. Please BE SURE to follow the instructions to fill fields in template.\nThere are lot of cases when you could open an issue:\n bug report feature request performance issues feature proposal feature design help wanted doc incomplete test improvement any questions on project and so on  Also we must remind that when filing a new issue, please remember to remove the sensitive data from your post. Sensitive data could be password, secret key, network locations, private business data and so on.\nCode and doc contribution Every action to make project Dragonfly better is encouraged. On GitHub, every improvement for Dragonfly could be via a PR (short for pull request).\n If you find a typo, try to fix it! If you find a bug, try to fix it! If you find some redundant codes, try to remove them! If you find some test cases missing, try to add them! If you could enhance a feature, please DO NOT hesitate! If you find code implicit, try to add comments to make it clear! If you find code ugly, try to refactor that! If you can help to improve documents, it could not be better! If you find document incorrect, just do it and fix that! \u0026hellip;  Actually it is impossible to list them completely. Just remember one princinple:\n WE ARE LOOKING FORWARD TO ANY PR FROM YOU.\n Since you are ready to improve Dragonfly with a PR, we suggest you could take a look at the PR rules here.\n Workspace Preparation Branch Definition Commit Rules PR Description  Workspace Preparation To put forward a PR, we assume you have registered a GitHub ID. Then you could finish the preparation in the following steps:\n FORK Dragonfly to your repository. To make this work, you just need to click the button Fork in right-left of alibaba/Dragonfly main page. Then you will end up with your repository in https://github.com/\u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/Dragonfly, in which your-username is your GitHub username.\n CLONE your own repository to develop locally. Use git clone https://github.com/\u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/Dragonfly.git to clone repository to your local machine. Then you can create new branches to finish the change you wish to make.\n Set Remote upstream to be https://github.com/alibaba/Dragonfly.git using the following two commands:\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/alibaba/Dragonfly.git git remote set-url --push upstream no-pushing   With this remote setting, you can check your git remote configuration like this:\n$ git remote -v origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/Dragonfly.git (fetch) origin https://github.com/\u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/Dragonfly.git (push) upstream https://github.com/alibaba/Dragonfly.git (fetch) upstream no-pushing (push)  Adding this, we can easily synchronize local branches with upstream branches.\nBranch Definition Right now we assume every contribution via pull request is for branch master in Dragonfly. Before contributing, be aware of branch definition would help a lot.\nAs a contributor, keep in mind again that every contribution via pull request is for branch master. While in project Dragonfly, there are several other branches, we generally call them rc branches, release branches and backport branches.\nBefore officially releasing a version, we will checkout a rc(release candidate) branch. In this branch, we will test more than branch master.\nWhen officially releasing a version, there will be a release branch before tagging. After tagging, we will delete the release branch.\nWhen backporting some fixes to existing released version, we will checkout backport branches. After backporting, the backporting effects will be in PATCH number in MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH of SemVer.\nCommit Rules Actually in Dragonfly, we take two rules serious when committing:\n Commit Message Commit Content  Commit Message Commit message could help reviewers better understand what is the purpose of submitted PR. It could help accelerate the code review procedure as well. We encourage contributors to use EXPLICIT commit message rather than ambiguous message. In general, we advocate the following commit message type:\n docs: xxxx. For example, \u0026ldquo;docs: add docs about storage installation\u0026rdquo;. feature: xxxx.For example, \u0026ldquo;feature: make result show in sorted order\u0026rdquo;. bugfix: xxxx. For example, \u0026ldquo;bugfix: fix panic when input nil parameter\u0026rdquo;. style: xxxx. For example, \u0026ldquo;style: format the code style of Constants.java\u0026rdquo;. refactor: xxxx. For example, \u0026ldquo;refactor: simplify to make codes more readable\u0026rdquo;. test: xxx. For example, \u0026ldquo;test: add unit test case for func InsertIntoArray\u0026rdquo;. chore: xxx. For example, \u0026ldquo;chore: integrate travis-ci\u0026rdquo;. It\u0026rsquo;s the type of mantainance change. other readable and explicit expression ways.  On the other side, we discourage contributors from committing message like the following ways:\n fix bug update add doc  Commit Content Commit content represents all content changes included in one commit. We had better include things in one single commit which could support reviewer\u0026rsquo;s complete review without any other commits\u0026rsquo; help. In another word, contents in one single commit can pass the CI to avoid code mess. In brief, there are two minor rules for us to keep in mind:\n avoid very large change in a commit; complete and reviewable for each commit.  No matter commit message, or commit content, we do take more emphasis on code review.\nPR Description PR is the only way to make change to Dragonfly project files. To help reviewers better get your purpose, PR description could not be too detailed. We encourage contributors to follow the PR template to finish the pull request.\nEngage to help anything We choose GitHub as the primary place for Dragonfly to collaborate. So the latest updates of Dragonfly are always here. Although contributions via PR is an explicit way to help, we still call for any other ways.\n reply to other\u0026rsquo;s issues if you could; help solve other user\u0026rsquo;s problems; help review other\u0026rsquo;s PR design; help review other\u0026rsquo;s codes in PR; discuss about Dragonfly to make things clearer; advocate Dragonfly technology beyond GitHub; write blogs on Dragonfly and so on.  Issue template Use this template to create an issue.\nIssue Description\nDescribe what happened:\nDescribe what you expected to happen:\nHow to reproduce it (as minimally and precisely as possible): 1. 2. 3.\nAnything else we need to know?:\nEnvironment: - Dragonfly version (see file:VERSION): - OS (e.g. from /etc/os-release): - Kernel (e.g. uname -a): - Others:\nPull request template Use this template to create an issue.\n1.Describe what this PR did\n2.Does this pull request fix one issue? 3.Describe how you did it\n4.Describe how to verify it\n5.Special notes for reviews\n"

	"content": "        \nWhat is Dragonfly? Dragonfly is an intelligent P2P based image and file distribution system. It aims to resolve issues related to low-efficiency, low-success rate and waste of network bandwidth in file transferring process. Especially in large-scale file distribution scenarios such as application distribution, cache distribution, log distribution, image distribution, etc. In Alibaba, Dragonfly is invoiked 2 Billion times and the data distributed is 3.4PB every month. Dragonfly has become one of the most important pieces of infrastructure at Alibaba. The reliability is up to 99.9999%.\nWhile container technologies makes devops life easier most of the time, it sure brings a some challenges: the efficiency of image distribution, especially when you have to replicate image distribution on several hosts. Dragonfly works extremely well with both Docker and PouchContainer for this scenario. It also is compatible with any other container formats.\nIt delivers up to 57 times the throughput of native docker and saves up to 99.5% the out bandwidth of registry.\nDragonfly makes it simple and cost-effective to set up, operate, and scale any kind of files/images/data distribution.\nWhy Dragonfly? The project is an open source version of the dragonfly and more internal features will be gradually opened.\n P2P based file distribution: Using P2P technology for file transmission, which can make full use of the bandwidth resources of each peer to improve download efficiency, saves a lot of cross-IDC bandwidth, especially costly cross-board bandwidth Non-invasive support all kinds of container technologies: Dragonfly can seamlessly support various containers for distributing images. Host level speed limit: Many downloading tools(wget/curl) only have rate limit for the current download task,but dragonfly also provides rate limit for the entire host. Passive CDN: The CDN mechanism can avoid repetitive remote downloads. Strong consistency： Dragonfly can guarantee that all downloaded files must be consistent even if users do not provide any check code(MD5). Disk protection and high efficient IO: Precheck Disk space, delay synchronization, write file-block in the best order, split net-read / disk-write, and so on. High performance: Cluster Manager is completely closed-loop, which means, it does not rely on any DB or distributed cache, processing requests with extremely high performance. Exception auto isolation: Dragonfly will automatically isolate exception nodes(peer or Cluster Manager) to improve download stability. No pressure on file source: Generally, as long as a few Cluster Managers download file from the source. Support standard http header: Support http header, Submit authentication information through http header. Effective concurrency control of Registry Auth: Reduce the pressure of the Registry Auth Service. Simple and easy to use: Very few configurations are needed.  How does it stack up against traditional solution?    Test Environment      Dragonfly server 2 * (24core 64GB 2000Mb/s)   File Source server 2 * (24core 64GB 2000Mb/s)   Client 4core 8GB 200Mb/s   Target file size 200MB   Executed Date 2016-04-20    For Dragonfly, no matter how many clients issue the file downloading, the average downloading time is always around 12 seconds. And for wget, the downloading time keeps increasing when you have more clients, and as the amount of wget clients reaches 1200, the file source will crash, then it can not serve any client.\nWho has adopted Dragonfly?
